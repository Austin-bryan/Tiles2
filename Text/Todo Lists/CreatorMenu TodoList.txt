---- Make color selection based off clicks, not just down presses
---- Triangle should follow mouse
    Automatically snaps until moved far enough
    if shift => rounds to up or down
        if in hex board, rounds to up, right, left
    make tirangle more natural
    prevent shortcuts for angle work while square is not selectedd

    ---- Add More
        ---- Circle
        ---- Square
        ---- Triangle
    ---- Change angle buttons
        ---- (Under the hood these call the same functions but are visually simpler)
        ---- 3 angles for square
        ---- Hide for circle and triangle   
        ---- When returning to square, resets its angle to be flat
    ---- Buttons highlight to show active combination
    
    Custom panel with header 
        adjusts with size
        text
        icon
    have snap angle for triangle selection change to align with the hexboard better
    Highlight color when selecting tile
        if selecting multiple, override the toggle feature to show that multiple colors are selected
    Collapse windows
        Expand

---- bug where slant selection entirely breaks vertices
make sure rotator matches symmetry level
    4 arrows for Square
    3 arrows for Triangle
    6 arrows for Hexagon
    have less arrows if is bandaged tile with less symmetry
        ie: a rectangle should have two arrows
          : some shapes won't have enough symmetry so they shouldn't be allowed to be rotators
    Giant shapes, like a 4x4 bandaged, should rotate as expected
Add rounded corners for Triangle when merging in weird angles
Fix bugs with black lines being visible in mesh
When merging bandages, call unmerge, then merge
Bug where shift selecting separate bandage tiles makes it look like its separate bandages, but the game treats them all as one
    | Need system to tell when bandage tiles are disconnected and when to separate them
